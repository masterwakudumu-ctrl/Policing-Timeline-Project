# Policing History Timeline

This is the interactive Policing History Timeline site.

## Files
- `index.html` — main site page
- `styles.css` — custom styles (Tailwind also used via CDN)
- `script.js` — JavaScript for interactive features

## Hosting
You can host this on:
- GitHub Pages (just push these files to a repository and enable Pages)
- Netlify / Vercel (drag-and-drop deploy)
- Local: open `index.html` in a browser

## Notes
The full interactive code is embedded in `index.html`. 
You can also move the JavaScript logic into `script.js` for cleaner separation.
